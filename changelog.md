# Changelog

- [v1.1.0](#v1.1.0-h)
- [v1.0.1](#v1.0.1-h)
___
### <a id="v1.1.0-h"></a> v1.1.0
### Major
- Added "Any%" run category. With Any%, rules are now reversed: points are acquired by completing
  levels regardless of score/finesse â€“ SS'ing levels will give a free skip.
- Maps are now pre-installed before and during runs to mitigate map download times.
- Maps are now fetched from a remote list on startup, rather than stored
  locally. (Therefore, the map list can be updated without needing to install a
  new version of the app.)
- The run timer now pauses for a fixed number of seconds between levels, to account for in-game loading times.
### Minor
- Removed Casual and Hard modes from preset list.
- Remove extra RMA header in setup page.
- Added error screens/logs ("error.log") in case of fatal errors during runs
